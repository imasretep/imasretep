# 👋 Hi, I’m Sami (@imasretep)

- 🎓 I am currently studying a Bachelor's Degree in Business Information Technology (210 ECTS credits, 3.5 years) at Karelia University of Applied Sciences. I began studying programming in autumn 2022

- 👀 I really enjoy both frontend and backend development, which is why I’m aiming to become a full-stack developer. I love the versatility of working on both aspects of development to create complete solutions.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development techniques, focusing on frontend frameworks like React and backend technologies like Node.js and .NET. I’m also diving into C++ and JUCE to explore VST plugin development.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve application development, especially in fields like entrepreneurship, small business solutions, and creative coding with audio technologies.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Besides coding, I enjoy composing music, funny cat videos and good food!
